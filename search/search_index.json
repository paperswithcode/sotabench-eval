This library contains a collection of deep learning benchmarks you can use to benchmark your models. It can be used in conjunction with the sotabench website to record results for models, so the community can compare model performance on different tasks, as well as a continuous integration style service for your repository to benchmark your models on each commit. sotabencheval is a general benchmarking library, meaning it is designed to support all deep learning frameworks, and requires minimal code integration. There are alternative sotabench APIs you can use that are specialized for particular frameworks, e.g. torchbench for PyTorch. Getting Started : Benchmarking on ImageNet Step One : Create a sotabench.py file in the root of your repository This can contain whatever logic you need to load and process the dataset, and to produce model predictions for it. To record your results for sotabench, initialise an ImageNet evaluator object to name the model (and optionally) link to a paper: from sotabencheval.image_classification import ImageNetEvaluator evaluator = ImageNetEvaluator ( model_name = 'ResNeXt-101-32x8d' , paper_arxiv_id = '1611.05431' ) For each batch of predictions made by your model, pass a dictionary of keys as image IDs and values as output predictions to the evaluator.add method: evaluator . add ( dict ( zip ( image_ids , batch_output ))) Then after you have accumulated all the predictions: evaluator . save () This will ensure results are evaluated and saved when they are run on the sotabench server. Below you can see a working sotabench.py file added to the torchvision repository to test one of its models, integrating the evaluation code from above: import numpy as np import PIL import torch from torch.utils.data import DataLoader from torchvision.models.resnet import resnext101_32x8d import torchvision.transforms as transforms from torchvision.datasets import ImageNet from sotabencheval.image_classification import ImageNetEvaluator from sotabencheval.utils import is_server if is_server (): DATA_ROOT = './.data/vision/imagenet' else : # local settings DATA_ROOT = '/home/ubuntu/my_data/' model = resnext101_32x8d ( pretrained = True ) input_transform = transforms .

Getting Started You'll need the following in the root of your repository: sotabench.py file - contains benchmarking logic; the server will run this on each commit requirements.txt file - Python dependencies to be installed before running sotabench.py sotabench_setup.sh (optional) - any advanced dependencies or setup, e.g. compilation You can write whatever you want in your sotabench.py file to get model predictions on the COCO dataset. For example, PyTorch users might use torchvision to load the dataset. But you will need to record your results for the server, and you'll want to avoid doing things like downloading the dataset on the server. So you should: Point to the server COCO data paths - popular datasets are pre-downloaded on the server. Include an Evaluation object in sotabench.py file to record the results. Use Caching (optional) - to speed up evaluation by hashing the first batch of predictions. We explain how to do these various steps below. Server Data Location The COCO validation data is located in the root of your repository on the server at .data/vision/coco . In this folder is contained: annotations_trainval2017.zip - containing annotations for the validation images val2017.zip - containing the validation images Your local COCO files may have a different file directory structure, so you can use control flow like below to change the data path if the script is being run on sotabench servers: from sotabencheval.utils import is_server if is_server (): DATA_ROOT = './.data/vision/coco' else : # local settings DATA_ROOT = '/home/ubuntu/my_data/' This will detect if sotabench.py is being run on the server and change behaviour accordingly. How Do I Initialize an Evaluator? Add this to your code - before you start batching over the dataset and making predictions: from sotabencheval.object_detection import COCOEvaluator evaluator = COCOEvaluator ( model_name = 'My Super Model' ) If you are reproducing a model from a paper, then you can enter the arXiv ID. If you put in the same model name string as on the leaderboard then you will enable direct comparison with the paper's model. For example: from sotabencheval.object_detection import COCOEvaluator evaluator = COCOEvaluator ( model_name = 'Mask R-CNN' , paper_arxiv_id = '1703.06870' ) The above will directly compare with the result of the paper when run on the server. How Do I Evaluate Predictions? The evaluator object has an .add() method to submit predictions by batch or in full. For COCO the expected input is a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains detection information that will be used by the loadRes method based on the pycocotools API. Each detection can take a dictionary like the following: { 'image_id' : 397133 , 'bbox' : [ 386.1628112792969 , 69.48855590820312 , 110.14895629882812 , 278.2847595214844 ], 'score' : 0.999152421951294 , 'category_id' : 1 } For this benchmark, only bounding box detection ('bbox') is performed at present. You can do this all at once in a single call to add() , but more naturally, you will probably loop over the dataset and call the method for the outputs of each batch. That would look something like this (for a PyTorch example): ... evaluator = COCOEvaluator ( model_name = 'Mask R-CNN' , paper_arxiv_id = '1703.06870' ) with torch . no_grad (): for i , ( input , target ) in enumerate ( data_loader ): ... output = model ( input ) # potentially formatting of the output here to be a list of dicts evaluator . add ( output ) When you are done, you can get the results locally by running: evaluator . get_results () But for the server you want to save the results by running: evaluator . save () This method serialises the results and model metadata and stores to the server database. How Do I Cache Evaluation? Sotabench reruns your script on every commit. This is good because it acts like continuous integration in checking for bugs and changes, but can be annoying if the model hasn't changed and evaluation is lengthy. Fortunately sotabencheval has caching logic that you can use. The idea is that after the first batch, we hash the model outputs and the current metrics and this tells us if the model is the same given the dataset. You can include hashing within an evaluation loop like follows (in the following example for a PyTorch repository): with torch . no_grad (): for i , ( input , target ) in enumerate ( data_loader ): ... output = model ( input ) # potentially formatting of the output here to be a list of dicts evaluator . add ( output ) if evaluator . cache_exists : break evaluator . save () If the hash is the same as in the server, we infer that the model hasn't changed, so we simply return hashed results rather than running the whole evaluation again. Caching is very useful if you have large models, or a repository that is evaluating multiple models, as it speeds up evaluation significantly.

This incorporates all the features explained above: (a) using the server data root, (b) using the COCO Evaluator, and (c) caching the evaluation logic.

Use Caching (optional) - to speed up evaluation by hashing the first batch of predictions. We explain how to do these various steps below. Server Data Location The VOC 2012 data is located in the root of your repository on the server at .data/vision/voc2012 . In this folder is contained: VOCtrainval_11-May-2012.tar - containing validation images and annotations Your local VOC 2012 files may have a different file directory structure, so you can use control flow like below to change the data path if the script is being run on sotabench servers: from sotabencheval.utils import is_server if is_server (): DATA_ROOT = './.data/vision/voc2012' else : # local settings DATA_ROOT = '/home/ubuntu/my_data/' This will detect if sotabench.py is being run on the server and change behaviour accordingly. How Do I Initialize an Evaluator? Add this to your code - before you start batching over the dataset and making predictions: from sotabencheval.semantic_segmentation import PASCALVOCEvaluator evaluator = PASCALVOCEvaluator ( model_name = 'My Super Model' ) If you are reproducing a model from a paper, then you can enter the arXiv ID. If you put in the same model name string as on the leaderboard then you will enable direct comparison with the paper. For example: from sotabencheval.semantic_segmentation import PASCALVOCEvaluator evaluator = PASCALVOCEvaluator ( model_name = 'PSPNet' , paper_arxiv_id = '1612.01105' ) The above will directly compare with the result of the paper when run on the server. How Do I Evaluate Predictions? The evaluator object has an .add() method to submit predictions by batch or in full. For PASCAL there are two required arguments: outputs , a 1D np.ndarray of semantic class predictions per label, and targets , a 1D np.ndarray of ground truth semantic classes per pixel. In other words, it requires flattened inputs and outputs. To elaborate, suppose you are making predictions, batch by batch, and have your model output and the original targets with batch_size 32 , and image size (520, 480) . The shape of your outputs might look like: batch_output . shape >> ( 32 , 21 , 520 , 480 ) # where 21 is the number of VOC classes batch_target . shape >> ( 32 , 520 , 480 ) We can flatten the entire output and targets to 1D vectors for each pixel: flattened_batch_output . shape >> ( 7987200 ) # flatten by taking the max class prediction # (batch_output.argmax(1).flatten() in torch with class as second dimension) flattened_batch_target . shape >> ( 7987200 ) # (batch_target.flatten() in torch) The output might look something like this: flattened_batch_output >> array ([ 6 , 6 , 6 , 6 , 6 , ... ]) flattened_batch_target >> array ([ 6 , 6 , 6 , 6 , 6 , ... ]) In both cases, the prediction and ground truth have class 6 as the semantic label for the first 5 pixels - so the model is correct. These flattened arrays can then be passed into the .add() method of the evaluator my_evaluator . update ( outputs = flattened_batch_output , targets = flattened_batch_target ) You can do this all at once in a single call to add() , but more naturally, you will probably loop over the dataset and call the method for the outputs of each batch. That would like something like this (for a PyTorch example): PYTHON CODE HERE When you are done, you can get the results locally by running: evaluator . get_results () But for the server you want to save the results by running: evaluator . save () This method serialises the results and model metadata and stores to the server database. How Do I Cache Evaluation? Sotabench reruns your script on every commit. This is good because it acts like continuous integration in checking for bugs and changes, but can be annoying if the model hasn't changed and evaluation is lengthy. Fortunately sotabencheval has caching logic that you can use. The idea is that after the first batch, we hash the model outputs and the current metrics and this tells us if the model is the same given the dataset. You can include hashing within an evaluation loop like follows (in the following example for a PyTorch repository): evaluator = PASCALVOCEvaluator ( root = './data' , dataset_year = '2012' , split = 'val' , model_name = 'FCN (ResNet-101)' , paper_arxiv_id = '1605.06211' ) with torch . no_grad (): for image , target in tqdm . tqdm ( data_loader_test ): image , target = image . to ( 'cuda' ), target . to ( 'cuda' ) output = model ( image ) output = output [ 'out' ] evaluator . add ( output . argmax ( 1 ) . flatten () . cpu () . numpy (), target . flatten () . cpu () . numpy ()) if evaluator . cache_exists : break evaluator . save () If the hash is the same as in the server, we infer that the model hasn't changed, so we simply return hashed results rather than running the whole evaluation again.
